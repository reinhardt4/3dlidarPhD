# 3dlidarPhD

This repository contains MATLAB code associated with the dissertation (and associated publications):
Evaluation and correction of 3D flash LiDAR imagers, A. Reinhardt, University of Dayton, (2021)

As of 9/4/2021:
MATLAB files include capability for frame grabbing in MATLAB (image acquistion toolbox or calling an external executable), non-uniformity correction, range walk error correction, including applying corrections to data.  

Tools to be added include:
A tool that will simulation data obtained from a 3D flash LiDAR imager.
Tools for post-processing data into correction tables.
Python-versions of this code.
Simulated data samples as both .mat MATLAB-files and .npz numpy-files
